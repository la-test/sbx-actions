# This files uses YAML anchors which allows reuse of multiple keys

keys:
  # The following public keys can be found in secrets/.public-keys
  # They have to be imported and trusted
  # E.g.: `gpg --import ...` and `gpg --edit-key ...`
  # First the PGP fingerprints of the admin (hardware token recommanded)
  - &adm_ben 411eb16d13b422490feba1155a7a09f0c279fcd6
  - &adm_last-resort-a eaf916fd9ccda8288b9c5e3a7cc75588b18b3e9b
  - &adm_last-resort-c a229968d0fa44960493ea207619b4427113ef6c8
  # Then the PGP fingerprints derivated of the sshd RSA key of the servers
  # which can be obtain by running the following command on the server
  # nix-shell -p ssh-to-pgp --run "ssh-to-pgp -i /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key -email root@`hostname`"
  # ...
  # Finally, the PGP fingerprints from dedicated keys (not uses by sshd)
  # - &srv_github-actions ...
creation_rules:
  # The following files can be created with:

  # To update after changing the keys:
